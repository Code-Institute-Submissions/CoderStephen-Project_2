        <h2>How to play.</h2>
        <p>Each player must choose by clicking one of the following gestures: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.<br> After each player plays
        their gesture, the winner is determined by who's gesture beats the other. If you both happen to choose the same gesture
        then it is a draw. Below is a helpful graph to show you which match ups win. Good luck!!!
